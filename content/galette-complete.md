- 1 egg
- 20g grated Gruyère (or Emmental or Cheddar)

1. When butter has melted, break the egg into the centre and spread the white a little with a spatula
1. When the egg is almost cooked, sprinkle the cheese and ham over the white
1. When the cheese begins to melt, fold in the edges into a square so they cover most of the white but leave the yolk
