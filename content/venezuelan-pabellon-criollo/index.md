Pronounced: (pah-beh-yon) (cree-oh-yoh)

This is a traditional Venezuelan dish. I make it when I feel like I need a taste of home. Lots of prep time, but very
worth it

Four components

1. [Pulled Beef](#pulled-beef)
2. [Black beans](#black-beans)
3. [White rice](#white-rice)
4. [Fried plantains](#fried-plantains)

## Pulled Beef

- Beef skirt or flank steak
- 1 Sweet onion
- 1 Red/Yellow/Orange bell pepper
- 2 cloves of garlic (more if desired)
- 3/4 small sweet (not hot!) chilis. Known as \"ají dulce\" in Spanish, these are native to the Caribbean. It's hard to
  find, but it's very worth it. Optional if you can\'t find them (I never can).
- 1/2 Tbsp of cumin
- Beef stock

Slice the onion in half and place in a large stockpot with the skirt steak rolled up. Cover entirely in the beef stock
and braise for 2-4 hours (depending on the amount of steak you buy). You want to have it tender enough to pull apart
with two forks. Keep some of the stock, and shred the beef. Put aside while you prepare the sauté (salteado). In a hot
pan with neutral oil, sauté the onion (thinly sliced) and bell pepper (thinly sliced). Once you get some colour, add the
cumin, garlic, and sweet chilli if you use them. Sauté for another 30 seconds, and then add the beef. Sauté until some
fond shows up and deglaze with the braising liquid. Reduce to a glossy consistency. Season with salt to taste.

## Black Beans

- 300g of dry black beans
- 120g of good bacon
- 3 cloves of garlic
- 1 green bell pepper

Soak the beans (min. 8 hours, preferably overnight). Slice the bacon into lardons. In a Dutch oven or large pot, render
their fat. Take out and sauté the thinly sliced bell pepper and minced garlic in the rendered fat. Enjoy the smells of
the gods. Add the bacon, black beans and enough of their soaking liquid to cover. Bring to a boil and simmer until the
beans are very soft. Use a potato masher to partially mash the beans (you still want some big chunks). Season with salt
to taste.

## White Rice

It's white rice. You do you :)

## Fried Plantains

- Fry oil
- Ripe plantains

Slice the plantains on the diagonal and fry at medium temperature until golden brown. Remove to paper-towel-lined plate
to drain. Season immediately with salt.

Add enough of each component to the plate to have an equal-way split. Optionally grate a salty, solid, fresh white
cheese over the beans/plantains (halloumi works). Escape to the Caribbean
