So I actually just wrote this recipe out after making it for some friends of mine. Two of them are very picky eaters,
one of which swears she hates cauliflower and will never eat it, the other just generally doesn\'t like most cooked
veggies and they all love this.

It's a bit of a weird chili, it\'s not a tomato base so don\'t expect it to come out looking like a normal chili. But
it\'s full of flavor and will warm you up on a cold dreary rainy day. It\'s one of my go-to meals if I\'m cooking for a
group of people or just want to cook ahead to have healthy meals for a few nights for myself.

Great for warming you up on days when it\'s rainy and cold. Also good for sneaking vegetables into meals for friends or
family members that swear they hate cauliflower.

Keeps well in the fridge

## Ingredients

- 2 packages ground turkey ( about 500g or 1lb)
- 1 large white or purple onion diced
- 6 or 7 celery sticks diced
- 2 carrots peeled and diced
- 1 head of cauliflower chopped up small or riced
- 1 jalapeño diced
- 1 red pepper diced
- 1 yellow pepper diced
- 1 can pinto beans
- 1 can white beans or kidney beans
- 1 can black beans
- 1 can coconut milk
- 4 or 5 tbsp of chili powder mix (I use a mix like THIS or make my own similar blend)
- A dash of oregano and basil
- 1tsp garlic powder or use fresh
- Cayenne to taste
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Franks or hot sauce of your choice to taste
- Half a tsp of bouillon
- 1 to 2 tsp of cornstarch to thicken
- Cheddar cheese, shredded

## Directions

1.  Set a large pot or stockpot to heat and begin to wash and prep your veggies. Start with dicing the onions as they
    will go in first of the veggies.
2.  As you prep your veggies, start off by browning your ground turkey. Break up large lumps of turkey while it cooks.
    Add a tbsp or two of the chili powder mix to flavour the meat.
3.  Once your turkey is completely cooked, add diced onions. Saute until onions have started to turn translucent. If
    using fresh garlic you can add it here.
4.  Begin to add rest of veggies as they are chopped. Carrots and cauliflower first usually as they need slightly more
    time to cook than the peppers.
5.  Once all the veggies are in and starting to cook down, add your can of coconut milk. I prefer the thicker variety of
    coconut milk, but whatever you have will work.
6.  Add remaining 2 tbsp of chili powder mix and remaining spices, and allow veggies to cook down and start to release
    their water. At this point the chili will be pretty watery. Once this happens you can stir 1 or 2 tsp or cornstarch
    (or white flour) into about 100ml (1/4cup) of cold water with bouillon then add to chili liquid to thicken.
7.  Open and rinse your various canned beans. Add to pot.
8.  Allow to simmer for 15 to 20 min and season with salt/pepper/franks/cayenne to taste.
9.  As with any chilli, it's better the longer it simmers, but at this point it will smell delicious and is ready to
    serve. Top with shredded cheese and enjoy!
