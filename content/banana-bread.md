## Ingredients

- 3 very ripe bananas
- 115g unsalted butter, at room temperature
- 150g brown sugar (plus extra for sprinkling)
- 2 large eggs, lightly beaten
- 1 tbsp Greek yogurt
- 187.5g plain flour
- 1 tsp baking soda
- ½ tsp salt
- ½ tsp vanilla extract
- 117g walnuts

## Method

### Preparation

1. **Preheat oven** to 180°C (fan).
1. **Prepare the pan**: Grease and flour a 9.25" x 5.25" x 2.75" loaf pan, then sprinkle brown sugar in the pan to coat
   the bottom and sides.
1. **Prepare walnuts**: Lightly toast walnuts in a dry skillet over medium heat, stirring continuously to prevent
   burning (2-3 minutes). Coarsely chop and set aside to cool.

### Making the Batter

1. **Cream butter and sugar**: In a large mixing bowl, cream together the softened butter and 150g brown sugar until
   light and fluffy.
1. **Add wet ingredients**: Mash bananas with a fork until they reach a chunky applesauce consistency. Add mashed
   bananas, beaten eggs, and Greek yogurt to the butter mixture, mixing until well combined.
1. **Combine dry ingredients**: In a separate bowl, whisk together flour, baking soda, and salt.
1. **Bring it together**: Add the flour mixture to the wet ingredients and mix until just combined. Stir in vanilla
   extract and chopped walnuts - don't overmix.

### Baking

1. **Fill the pan**: Pour batter into the prepared loaf pan and sprinkle the top with additional brown sugar.
1. **Bake**: Place in preheated oven for 55-60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
1. **Cool**: Let the banana bread rest in the pan for 10 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely.

## Tips

- The riper your bananas, the better the flavor - look for heavily spotted or even black-skinned bananas
- Don't overmix the batter once you add the flour to avoid a tough texture
- Store covered at room temperature for up to 3 days, or freeze for up to 3 months
