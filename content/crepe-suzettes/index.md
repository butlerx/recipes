This should give you around 12 crêpes which is 4 portions

## Ingredients

- 4 eggs
- 480 ml (2 cup) of floor
- 60 ml (4 tbsp) of sugar (optional, not really needed if you are already going to put Maple syrup when you serve it)
- a touch of salt
- 700 ml (3 cup) of milk
- oil for the pan

## Directions

1. Mix the floor, sugar and salt
1. Mix the eggs and the milk and then mix with the step 1
1. Pre-heat a pan and oil it (cast iron is the best for this, but a regular non-stick will also do the trick)
1. Put in a little of the mix until you fill the pan (these are thin crêpes, not pancake so don't put too much), cook
   for around 1 min and flip once it starts to be more solid

Serve with Maple syrup, fruits and/or spreadable chocolate.
