A childhood food for me, especially during the winter was polenta.

(It's been too warm to make it so I googled a picture)

To make it you need:

- 1 part cornmeal (1/3 of a cup is an OK sized portion)
- 3 parts water/stock/milk
- Optionally you can add
- Tomato sauce (with tons of garlic!)
- Some meat
- Cheese (a ton of it too)

You basically boil the cornmeal until it thickens, the one you normally buy only takes a few minutes. I've found it in
Fallon & Byrne and in the Asian Market

I love it because it reminds me of home and of my mom making it for me during it the winter 😊
