Blueberry Grunt is a popular dessert in Nova Scotia and the name is said to come from the "grunting" sound the
blueberries make while being cooked. The origins of the blueberry grunt are unclear. It's likely a combination of early
colonial settlers in Nova Scotia and the Acadians in Nova Scotia having to make "forage food".

My mom would whip this up during blueberry season, or on a cold winter's night with some frozen berries in the freezer
(Never canned!!!)

This recipe has an interesting history, it comes from Traditional Recipes of Atlantic Canada, which we collected,
section by section from the local gas station when I was growing up. Back when gas stations sold promotional
collectibles - it was the hot ticket item when you filled up your tank! We still have the mini binder of recipes at
home.

Isn't it just a cobbler?

NEVER! If you were to put it in the oven to brown, then yes it would be a cobbler. But because you steam the dumplings
in the blueberries over the stove, it's belovedly called a Blueberry Grunt.

## Ingredients

### Ingredient Subheading

- 4 Cups fresh or frozen blueberries (1 quart)
- 1/2 cup sugar
- 1/2 cup water
- Zest of 1 lemon, finely grated
- 1/2 tsp cinnamon
- 1.5 cups flour
- 2 tsp baking powder
- 1/4 tsp salt
- 1 tsp sugar
- 1 Tbsp butter or margarine
- 2/3 cup milk (soy milk works fine here)
- Whipped Cream or Vanilla Ice Cream or Yogurt to go with it!

## Directions

1.  In a large saucepan, heat blueberries, lemon zest, cinnamon, water and sugar slowly until blueberries begin to
    soften, then bring to a boil. Simmer gently (5 minutes) while making dumplings.
2.  Sift together flour, baking powder, salt and sugar. Cut in butter and add enough milk to make a soft dough.
3.  Drop dumpling dough, by the tablespoonful, into the pot onto the hot berries (makes approximately 10 dumplings).
4.  Cover tightly and cook for 15 minutes without raising the lid. I mean it, hands off the lid! Dumplings will double
    in size.
5.  Serve hot, spooning sauce over the dumplings. Top with cream, ice cream or yogurt.
