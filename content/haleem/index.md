It\'s no secret that I love food... I gain weight just looking at something
tasty, something delicious. It does not help that I have a ravenous appetite for
great (ok, my standards are lower, lets just say good to great) food in great
quantities. There are a few things that I am literally afraid of because they
could END me as I believe my appetite for them to be infinite. These are (in no
particular order):

- Maple Syrup (yes, I can drink it with impunity)
- Sushi (The OceanWise sustainable program has a picture of me with a red X on
  it on their wall)
- Lasagna (Garfield was an inspiration!)
- And my childhood favourite: Haleem

What is [Haleem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haleem) you ask?

It\'s essentially a thick, wheat/lentil based stew with meat. Several variations
of the dish exist throughout the silk route, with variations ranging from sweet
and breakfast-y (thank you Iran) to spicy and very very meat-y (props to
Pakistan, India in general, and the Hyderabad region in general). It is warm,
cozy and the ultimate fall/winter fattening food. Also, it can be made without
meat, so it is versatile. Below is a version that I have iterated on, though
nothing beats what my Mum and my Mother-in-Law make, and their versions are ones
that I can eat copious amounts, even though this is a fairly heavy dish.

#### Ingredients

- Grains (these can be substituted with one another if you can\'t find all of
  them...it\'s all good, it\'s the amount of grain though that is key. But you
  want to keep the amount of rice less)
  - 1/2 cup cracked wheat
  - 1 cup Split Chickpea lentil
  - 1/2 cup red Split pea lentil
  - 1/2 cup white split urad (black gram) lentil
  - 1/2 cup mung bean lentils
  - 1/2 cup basmati rice
- 1 cup oil
- 2 medium onions, sliced
- 6-7 cloves of garlic
- 1 inch ginger
- 1 cup deep fried onions (get them from an Indian store, or you could make your
  own...its called barista but its a lot of work so store bought is a good way
  to go)
- 1 kg beef, chicken or goat/lamb (my personal faves) with bone-in (for vegan, I
  would sub meaty vegetables here....mushrooms are a good candidate, or you can
  add another kind of bean like chickpeas, or I have heard people use nuts...its
  crazy)
- Salt to taste
- 2 tsp red chilli powder (add more or less depending on preference. Minimum 1/2
  tsp red chilli powder)
- 2 tsp coriander powder
- 1/2 tsp turmeric powder
- 1/2 tsp garam masala
- 4-5 cups of water

#### Directions

1.  Soak the Wheat and Lentils for at least 2-3 hours in water. Soak the rice
    for an hour
1.  Heat Oil in a deep stewing pot (or a pressure cooker like the instant pot)
1.  When the oil is hot, add the onions, garlic and ginger and cook until the
    onions are golden (DO NOT caramelize them though)
1.  Add the meat and cook till brown and tender
1.  Add salt, red chilli powder, turmeric powder, coriander powder and garam
    masala and cook till the oil separates.
1.  Once the oil has separated from the spices and the meat is cooked (approx.
    1.5 hours), add the water till the meat is well covered and cover the pot
    and cook (at least 45 minutes at high pressure instant pot). The goal is to
    cook the meat till it is falling apart
1.  In a separate pot, add the grains and cook them in about 1.5 volume of water
    to grains for at least 45 minutes until the grains are completely cooked
    Once the meat and grains are cooked, take them off the stove
1.  There should be a layer of oil in the meat...separate it and set aside the
    oil (you don't have to do this, because the oil serves as a topping, but you
    can just leave it)
1.  Use a fork to pull the meat apart like you would for a pulled pork or pulled
    beef or pulled chicken etc. I generally remove the bones and use an
    immersion blender on low to break up the meat
1.  Add the grains liquid to the meat and then cook on a medium stove while
    stirring it. It should get nice and thick and stringy...cook for another 1.5
    to 2 hours. It should become the consistency of a semi thick porridge Serve
    in bowls with the fried onions, strips of ginger, coriander and that oil
    from the other step (or olive oil) as topping. It is customary to have lime
    or lemon on it too.

This is the more traditional way to make this, though I do use the Instant Pot
to whip one up in a couple of hours of high pressure action with some shortcuts
(like cooking the grains in the same instant pot once the meat is cooked.

Enjoy and let me know how it goes!
