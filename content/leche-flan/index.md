Leche Flan is the Filipino version of crème brulée and is traditionally cooked in llaneras.

If unavailable, you can use a round cake or bundt pan. Small ramekins or muffin tins will also work for individual
servings.

## Ingredients (for 1 llanera)

- 7 egg yolks
- 1 can of evaporated milk
- 1 tsp of vanilla
- ½ cup white sugar

## Directions

1. Preheat oven to 350 °F

### Caramelize Sugar

1. Place llanera on your stove top and add 3tbsp of white sugar.
1. Cook over low-med heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon (my mom likes to use chopsticks) until sugar
   dissolves.
1. Set aside to cool down. Once you hear the cracking it's ready for the custard!

### Making the Custard

1. Combine all the ingredients together. To make mixing easier, break the yolks and whisk in the evaporated milk.
1. Strain at least twice into a separate container and remove air bubbles for a smoother consistency.
1. Transfer the mixture in the llanera and cover with foil for a water bath.

### Water Bath

1. Place the llanera into a larger baking pan and add ⅓ of water into the pan
1. Bake for 45min
1. Remove the llanera from the oven and allow to cool down

### Worth the wait

1. Once the llanera has cooled down, place in the fridge overnight
1. When ready to serve, use a butter knife to cut around the leche flan and flip it onto a plate. Now this dessert is
   ready to enjoy!!
