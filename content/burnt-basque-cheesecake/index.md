Makes one 10" cheesecake. The cheesecake can be made a day ahead, covered and
chilled. Be sure to let cheesecake sit for several hours at room temperature to
remove chill before serving.

## Ingredients

- 910g Cream Cheese, room temperature
- 300g caster Sugar
- 6 large eggs
- 480ml heavy cream
- 1/2 tsp of fine sea salt
- 1 tsp. vanilla extract
- 40g of plain flour

## Special Equipment

- A 10"-diameter springform pan

## Directions

1. Place a rack in middle of oven; preheat to 200°C. Butter pan, then line with
   2 overlapping 16x12" sheets of parchment, making sure parchment comes at
   least 2" above top of pan on all sides. Because the parchment needs to be
   pleated and creased in some areas to fit in pan, you won’t end up with a
   clean, smooth outer edge to the cake; that’s okay! Place pan on a rimmed
   baking sheet.
2. Beat cream cheese and sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the
   paddle attachment on medium-low speed, scraping down sides of bowl, until
   very smooth, no lumps remain, and sugar has dissolved, about 2 minutes.
3. Increase speed to medium and add eggs one at a time, beating each egg 15
   seconds before adding the next. Scrape down sides of bowl, then reduce mixer
   speed to medium-low. Add cream, salt, and vanilla and beat until combined,
   about 30 seconds.
4. Turn off mixer and sift flour evenly over cream cheese mixture using a
   fine-mesh sieve. Beat on low speed until incorporated, about 15 seconds.
   Scrape down sides of bowl (yet again) and continue to beat until batter is
   very smooth, homogenous, and silky, about 10 seconds.
5. Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake cheesecake until deeply golden brown on
   top and still very jiggly in the center, 60–65 minutes.
6. Let cool slightly (it will fall drastically as it cools), then unmold. Let
   cool completely. Carefully peel away parchment from sides of cheesecake.
   Slice into wedges and serve at room temperature
