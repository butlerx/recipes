I grew up in a heavily Italian neighborhood in New York; nothing says
Italian-American cuisine like Spaghetti & Meatballs.

For authenticity, all measures are US.

## Directions

- Soak 1/2 cup of breadcrumbs in just enough milk to cover them + allow to soak.
- Mix the breadcrumbs, 1/4 cup of flatleaf parsley (or arugula,) 1/2 cup of
  grated parmesan cheese and 1 large egg (or 3 tbsp aquafaba) in a large mixing
  bowl with 1 1/2 pounds of ground beef and 1/2 pound of ground pork and season
  to taste.
- Work all the ingredients together thoroughly with clean hands - the warmth of
  your hands softens the fat in the meat + helps bind the ingredients.
- Form into golf ball-sized balls by rolling between your palms then brown over
  medium heat in a generous pour of olive oil, turning regularly, for about 8
  minutes; alternatively, bake in a medium oven (350F) for 15 minutes.
- Yields about 20.

I like this
[recipe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=39&v=jh13Xd2loto&feature=youtu.be) for
the sauce.

Boil spaghetti in plenty of water (at least two quarts), heavily salted, for 8
minutes or until al dente.

Reserve a ladle of pasta water - the starch in the water helps the sauce stick
to the pasta - and toss with sauce and spaghetti in a serving dish. Top with
meatballs.

Leftover meatballs make great sandwiches, hot or cold!
