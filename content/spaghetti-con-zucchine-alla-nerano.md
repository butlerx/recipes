## Ingredients 
- About 16fl oz sunflower oil or vegetable oil, or, if you choose, olive oil 
- 8 to 10 small zucchine (courgetter)
- 75g chopped fresh basil
- Sea salt to taste
- Extra virgin olive oil 
- 500g spaghetti
- 200g grated Parmigiano-Reggiano

## Directions
1. Put the sunflower oil in a large pot and bring to a low boil over medium-high heat.
1. Slice the zucchine into thin rounds and fry in the oil until they are golden brown. Remove and set aside on paper towels.
1. Sprinkle with basil and salt.
1. Transfer to a bowl and drizzle liberally with olive oil.
1. Boil the pasta until al dente and strain, reserving about two cup fuls of the pasta water.
1. Place the cooked pasta in a large pan or pot over low heat along with the zucchine mixture and combine gently. 
1. Add the pasta water, a little at a time, to create a creamy texture. You may not use all of the pasta water.
1. Now add some of the Parmigiano to the mixture and continue to combine by stirring gently and tossing. When the mixture has a slight creaminess, remove from the stove and serve immediately.

**Note**: The zucchine mixture can be refrigerated for about 5 days for use at a later date. Best to bring it to room temperature before using.
