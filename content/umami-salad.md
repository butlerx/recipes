I had this a lot growing up at my best friend's house and it was a staple when I went to his cabin near Power River in
the summer when I was age 15-18. My friend's mom Marni would make a massive batch of this salad to feed a dozen kids,
she'd be cooking the bacon all afternoon, then she'd serve it along with lasagna and garlic bread. I would probably eat
at least 3 helpings of this salad. I got the recipe from her and started making it at home, usually quadrupling the
recipe to fit in a 1 litre container I used to have. We called it "Marni's salad". My friend called it Caesar salad (not
sure why). I'd bring it to potlucks all the time and it was always a hit. I'm giving it a new name now, "Umami salad"
thanks to the many sources of glutamates/umami here: MSG, Worcestershire, bacon, parmesan cheese.

The original version had a spice blend called "Beau Monde" by Spice Islands which I can't find anywhere, but it's
basically "Salt, Dextrose, Onion, Celery Seed" so I've substituted those in. Don't omit the MSG! I just use cheap
parmesan, don't need to use parmigiano reggiano for this.
