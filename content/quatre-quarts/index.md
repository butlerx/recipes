This is a traditional recipe from Brittany which is simple yet deliciously
lethal.

I was raised on this as a kid and other buttery recipes (in Brittany, if it
ain\'t salted butter, it ain\'t a recipe)

As the name suggests, it\'s four quarters of each ingredient. You weigh the eggs
to measure the rest.

## Ingredients

- 3 large eggs (weigh them, they will be your measure for all the other
  ingredients
- Same weight of white sugar
- Same weight of butter (salted preferred)
- Same weight in self raising white flour (cream is fine)

## Directions

1.  Preheat the oven at 250 (230 if using fan oven),
2.  Melt the butter in a bowl,
3.  Mix with the sugar until whitened,
4.  Save the whites of the eggs in a separate bowl,
5.  Mix the yolks with the sugar/butter,
6.  Beat the whites until you obtain a nice consistent foam,
7.  Add the white foam to the mixture without swirling, instead you break the
    whites into the dough by just piling it until you have something semi
    consistent
8.  Baking:
9.  Put the mixture in a rectangular dish (see picture),
10. Let it rise for 15 minutes,
11. Switch to 200 degrees (180 if using a fan oven),
12. Put a foil sheet on top of the cake so it does not burn,
13. Let it cook for roughly an extra 25-35mn depending on your oven (check
    regularly, it is baked when you put a blade in the middle and no dough comes
    out)

## Eating:

Set aside and let it cool before removing from the dish,

Serve when it is totally cooled.

Bon Appetit !
