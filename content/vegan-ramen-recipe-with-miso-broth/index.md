## Directions

1. Make the Broth: Adjust the rack to 4 to 6 inches below the broiler element and preheat the broiler to high. Toss
   eggplant, onion, garlic, and ginger with oil until coated on all surfaces. Transfer to a foil-lined broiler pan or
   rimmed baking sheet. Broil, turning vegetables occasionally until they are well charred on all surfaces and the
   eggplant is entirely tender (a knife inserted into it should meet no resistance around the stem or base). Remove from
   oven, lower rack to centre position, and adjust oven temperature to 400°F (204°C). Wrap eggplant in aluminium foil
   and reserve it for charred eggplant topping.
1. Transfer onions, ginger, and garlic to a large stock pot or Dutch oven. Add shiitake and maitake mushroom stems,
   kombu, dried porcinis, shiitakes, cabbage, leek, and scallions. Cover with water by 1 inch. Bring to a boil over high
   heat, reduce to a bare simmer, cover, and cook while making remaining toppings (about 1 1/2 hours).
1. Meanwhile, make the Roasted Sweet Potato and Mushroom Topping: Toss the sweet potato pieces, maitake or beech
   mushroom caps, and tender stems in a large bowl with canola oil, togarashi, and a big pinch of salt. Transfer to a
   foil-lined rimmed baking sheet and roast until the potatoes are tender and the mushrooms and potato are browned
   around their edges, about 25 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool.
1. For the Shiitake-Soy Tare: Combine shiitake mushroom caps, kombu, ginger, scallions, garlic, soy sauce, and mirin in
   a small saucepan. Bring to a bare simmer, cover, and cook, stirring occasionally, until liquid is reduced by about
   half and mushrooms are very tender and flavorful, about 30 minutes. Discard kombu, ginger, scallions, and garlic.
   Strain mushrooms through a fine mesh strainer set in a liquid measuring cup. Reserve mushrooms and cooking liquid
   separately.
1. For the Mushroom-Scallion Oil, Combine dried porcini, dried shiitake, scallions, and oil in a small saucepan. Place
   over medium heat and cook, stirring, until the scallions and mushrooms release a thin, steady stream of bubbles.
   Remove from heat, cover, and set aside to infuse.
1. For the Charred Eggplant Topping: Unwrap the eggplant and slit the skin lengthwise. Use a spoon to scoop the flesh
   and transfer it to a salad spinner. Discard the skin. Spin eggplant to remove excess liquid. Add eggplant liquid to
   the pot of stock on the stovetop. Transfer eggplant flesh to a small bowl and stir in sesame seeds and one tablespoon
   (15ml) of shiitake-soy tare. Season to taste with salt.
1. Finish the Broth: Strain broth through a fine-mesh strainer into a clean pot. Reserve whole garlic heads and discard
   remaining vegetables. Cut the top off the garlic heads and squeeze out the cloves (they should be very tender).
   Discard skins. Transfer garlic and 1/2 cup of roasted sweet potato to the jar of a blender. Add 1 cup (240ml) of
   strained stock. Blend, starting at low and increasing to high speed, until it is completely smooth, for about 1
   minute. Whisk the garlic/sweet potato mixture into the finished broth. You should have over 2 quarts (1.9L) of
   finished broth. Season broth to taste gently with salt. (We will add miso and soy sauce, so go lightly on the
   seasoning.)
1. To Serve: In a small bowl, stir together miso paste, sesame paste, minced garlic, and six tablespoons of shiitake-soy
   tare. Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Heat stock until just under a simmer on the
   stovetop. Preheat six serving bowls in the oven for 2 minutes. Remove from oven. Divide the miso mixture evenly among
   the six bowls. Add 1 1/2 cups (350ml) hot broth to each bowl and stir gently to incorporate the miso mixture. Taste
   and adjust seasoning with salt or more shiitake-soy tare if necessary. Cook ramen noodles in the boiling water for 90
   seconds. Drain carefully and divide evenly between the bowls. Drizzle each bowl with one tablespoon (15ml) of the
   mushroom-scallion oil. Top with simmered shiitake caps, roasted sweet potato, mushroom, eggplant mixture, and
   scallions. Sprinkle with more shichimi togarashi, if desired, and serve immediately.
