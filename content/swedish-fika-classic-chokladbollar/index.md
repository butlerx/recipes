My Mormor (mother's mother) is a master of Fika, the classic Swedish coffee and cake break. Usually we get a selection
of at least 3 types of cakes or treats with our coffee!

Chokladbollar are my favorite, a quick and easy no-bake recipe.

## Ingredients

- 100g softened butter
- 100ml caster sugar
- 1 tbsp vanilla sugar (alternatively add icing sugar and a drop of vanilla extract separately)
- 2-3 tbsp cocoa
- 300ml rolled oats (porridge oats)
- 2-3 tbsp cold strong coffee

## Directions

1. Beat butter, sugar and vanilla sugar till fluffy. Mix in cocoa.
1. Add the oats and coffee, mix well.
1. Roll the batter into balls, size is up to you but usually a bit smaller than a golf ball.
1. Garnish the balls in pearl sugar or coconut flakes (bacon bits for the Canadians maybe?)

Here is a [silly YouTube song](https://youtu.be/oRIeytEXGhQ) about Fika featuring chokladbollar:

This recipe comes from Sweden's most purchased book Sju Sorters Kakor (Seven Types of Cake), compiled from a national
competition held after WW2 rationing ended.
