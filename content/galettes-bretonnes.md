These savoury buckwheat pancakes are served in crêperies all over Brittany with fillings ranging from simple cheese to
elaborate charcuterie and seafood. They are also delicious filled with Nutella as a dessert course.

Translated from "La Bonne Cuisine Bretonne", found in the shop at Douarnenez boat museum. This batter contains an egg,
but some recipes omit it altogether, making them suitable for vegans.

## Ingredients

- 250g buckwheat flour
- 1 tsp sea salt
- 500ml water
- 1 large egg
- 20g melted butter (or oil)
- Fat for greasing (lard, butter, or vegetable oil)

## Directions

1. Put the buckwheat flour in a large mixing bowl with the salt
1. Make a well in the centre and break the egg into it
1. Mix from the centre with a wooden spoon, incorporating the flour gradually
1. Add the water a little at a time, beating between additions, until you have a fluid batter about the consistency of
   single cream. Add a drop more water if it is too thick
1. Leave to rest for at least an hour (the original recipe stipulates 24 hours)
1. Mix in the melted butter just before cooking — if the batter has been refrigerated the butter may form little flecks,
   but these will melt when cooking
1. Heat a large non-stick frying pan or crêpe pan and lightly grease it with oiled kitchen paper
1. Pour a ladleful of batter into the pan and swirl to coat the bottom — aim for a fairly thin pancake
1. Cook for about a minute until the batter is set and the underside is lightly browned
1. Flip and cook the other side for another minute
1. Stack cooked galettes on a warm plate covered with a tea towel or greaseproof paper to prevent drying out
