There are too many good recipes to share, so for simplicity, I'll share my dinner :) Though I used gailan instead of
broccoli :)

## Ingredients

- 12 oz beef (For a vegetarian option, use vegetables with low water content, such as root vegetables.)
- 1 lb broccoli
- 0.50 carrots
- 2 cloves garlic
- 1 small piece ginger
- 1 stem scallions

### Marinade Ingredients

- 1 tsp baking soda (you can tenderise meat physically by hammering the meat with a meat mallet.)
- 1 tbsp oyster sauce
- 1 tbsp light soy sauce
- 2 tbsp water
- 1 tbsp cornstarch
- 0.25 tsp white pepper
- 1 tsp sugar
- 1 tbsp cooking wine

### Sauce Ingredients

- 1 tbsp oyster sauce
- 1 tsp light soy sauce
- 1 tsp dark soy sauce
- 1 tbsp water
- 1 tbsp cooking wine

### Extra Ingredients

- 2 tbsp cooking oil
- 1 pinch salt
- 1 tbsp extra oil
- 1 tsp sesame oil

## Directions

### Step 1 - Cut & Wash Beef

Cut the beef (12 oz) against the grain into medium slices. Wash and strain the blood from the meat.

### Step 2 - Create Beef Marinade

Make the sauce by mixing baking soda (1 tsp), oyster sauce (1 tbsp), light soy sauce (1 tbsp), water (2 tbsp),
cornstarch (1 tbsp), white pepper (0.25 tsp), sugar (1 tsp), and cooking wine (1 tbsp).

### Step 3 - Mix Beef into Marinade

Add the beef (12 oz) to the marinade and massage to fully cover the meat with the marinade. Set aside and let it sit for
30 mins.

### Step 4 - Cut Broccoli & Vegetables

Cut the broccoli (1 lb) into bite-size pieces.

Cut the carrot (0.50) into thin slivers, the ginger (1 small piece) into small cubes, the scallions (1 stem) into small
pieces on a diagonal, and mince the garlic. (2 cloves)

### Step 5 - Create Sauce

In a small bowl, mix the oyster sauce (1 tbsp), light soy sauce (1 tsp), dark soy sauce (1 tsp), water (1 tbsp), cooking
wine (1 tbsp), sugar, cornstarch, and white pepper.

### Step 6 - Boil Broccoli

Boil the broccoli with some oil and salt and cook it to your preference. Drain once cooked.

### Step 7 - Cook Beef

Add some cooking oil (1 tbsp) to the marinated beef and mix until all the meat is lightly coated in oil. This will seal
in the juices of the meat.

Heat the wok to the highest heat, then add cooking oil (2 tbsp). Swirl the cooking oil around the wok to thoroughly coat
the bottom and sides. Pour out the excess oil.

Slowly lower the heat and put in the meat. Cook the beef for around 30-60 seconds. Or when it turns brown before
flipping it.

Flip the beef and cook it for 60-90 seconds or until it\'s mostly brown. It\'s OK, if it\'s a bit red, we will continue
to cook it with the vegetables.

Once mostly cooked, turn off the heat and remove the meat from the wok. Set aside.

### Step 8 - Stir-fry Vegetables & Beef

Add the remaining oil and stir-fry the sides.

Add the garlic (2 cloves) and ginger (1 small piece) first and fry for 20-30 seconds. Put the scallions (1 stem) and
carrot slices (0.50) and cook for another 20-30 seconds. Once cooked, add the broccoli (1 lb). Cook for another 30-40
seconds.

Add back the beef. Cook everything together for 30-45 seconds.

Because the broccoli absorbs much liquid, you can add extra water to the sauce. We suggest 1 tbsp if needed.

### Step 9 - Add Sauce & Stir-fry Everything

Add the sauce to the stir-fry and constantly mix for about 1 minute. Add sesame oil (1 tsp). Once everything is
incorporated, add a bit more leftover oil to coat the broccoliit will make it look very appetising.
