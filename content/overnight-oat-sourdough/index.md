**Note:** Prepare the night before you plan to Bake

## Ingredients

- 100g of Porridge oats
- 400g of bread flour
- 455g of water
- 10g salt
- 150g of sourdough starter

## Directions

- Soak 100g of porridge oats in 180g of water and leave in the fridge.
- Make an autolyse from 400g of bread flour and 275g of water.
- Leave both for 12 hours.
- Mix 10g of salt into the autolyse, then add oats and 150 g of sourdough starter.
- Kneed it all together to ensure the oats are distributed well, and the dough is supple. Leave it to rise for 4 hours.
- Pre-shape the dough into two loaves and rest for another 20-30 min.
- Then, on a floured work surface, shape it into a batard and place it in a baking tin to rise for another 2 hours.
- Cover the dough in porridge oats.
- Preheat oven to 250c
- Once hot enough, put bread in for 20-30 minutes. Put a oven safe pan of water in the base of the stove to generate
  steam.
- Once the loaf is the right colour, remove it from the tin and place it back in the oven for a further 10 minutes.
- Let it cool for 30 minutes on a wire rack before cutting it in.
