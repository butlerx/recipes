Leche Flan is the Filipino version of crème brulée and is traditionally cooked in llaneras.

If unavailable, you can use a round cake or bundt pan. Small ramekins or muffin tins will also work for individual
servings.

## Ingredients (for 1 llanera):

- 7 egg yolks
- 1 can of evaporated milk
- 1 tsp of vanilla
- ½ cup white sugar

## Directions:

1.  Preheat oven to 350 °F

#### Caramelize Sugar

2.  Place llanera on your stove top and add 3tbsp of white sugar.
3.  Cook over low-med heat, stirring constantly with a wooden spoon (my mom likes to use chopsticks) until sugar
    dissolves.
4.  Set aside to cool down. Once you hear the cracking it\'s ready for the custard!

#### Making the Custard

5.  Combine all the ingredients together. To make mixing easier, break the yolks and whisk in the evaporated milk.
6.  Strain at least twice into a separate container and remove air bubbles for a smoother consistency.
7.  Transfer the mixture in the llanera and cover with foil for a water bath.

#### Water Bath

8.  Place the llanera into a larger baking pan and add ⅓ of water into the pan
9.  Bake for 45min
10. Remove the llanera from the oven and allow to cool down

#### Worth the wait!!!

11. Once the llanera has cooled down, place in the fridge overnight
12. When ready to serve, use a butter knife to cut around the leche flan and flip it onto a plate. Now this dessert is
    ready to enjoy!!
