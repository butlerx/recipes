# White Chocolate Cheese Cake

## Ingredients

- 300g Digestive biscuits
- 150g Melted unsalted butter
- 400g White Chocolate, broken into pieces
- 300g Cream Cheese
- 250g Mascarpone
- 300ml Double Cream

## Instructions

1. Crush the biscuits in a food processor until completely ground. Add butter
   and whizz again until you have the desired crumbly consistency.
1. line the base of a 23cm deep, cake tin with baking paper. Add the biscuit
   mixture to the cake tin and pat it flat. Leave to set in the fridge for
   approximately 30 mins.
1. Begin melting the chocolate in a heatproof glass bowl over a small pan of hot
   water on a low heat. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking. Remove from the
   heat and leave to cool for 10 mins until barely warm but still liquid.
1. Meanwhile whisk the cream cheese and mascarpone together. Add double cream
   and keep whisking until the mixture is just holding its own shape. Finally,
   add the melted chocolate and whisk until just combined.
1. Spoon the mixture over the cooled and set biscuit base, then smooth the top.
   Return to the fridge to cool for at least 6 hrs until the topping is set.
   Finally, decorate with fruit.
