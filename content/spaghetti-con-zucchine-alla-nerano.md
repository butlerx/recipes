## Ingredients

- About 300ml sunflower oil or vegetable oil, or, if you choose, olive oil
- 8 to 10 small Courgette
- 75g chopped fresh basil
- Sea salt to taste
- Extra virgin olive oil
- 500g spaghetti
- 200g grated Parmigiano-Reggiano

## Directions

1. Put the sunflower oil in a large pot and bring to a low boil over medium-high heat.
2. Slice the zucchine into thin rounds and fry in the oil until golden brown. Remove and set aside on paper towels.
3. Sprinkle with basil and salt.
4. Transfer to a bowl and drizzle liberally with olive oil.
5. Boil the pasta until al dente and strain, reserving about two cups full of the pasta water.
6. Place the cooked pasta in a large pan or pot over low heat along with the zucchine mixture and combine gently.
7. Add the pasta water, a little at a time, to create a creamy texture. You may not use all of the pasta water.
8. Add some Parmigiano to the mixture and continue to combine by stirring gently and tossing. When the the mixture has a
   slight creaminess, remove from the stove and serve immediately.

**Note**: The zucchini mixture can be refrigerated for about 5 days for use at a later date. Best to bring it to room
temperature before using.
