There are so many Slimming World recipes that most members rave about and one I
have really wanted to try was the Taco Fries recipe. I've never had taco fries
before so I had no expectations but it turned out to be so easy and very tasty
too.

## Ingredients;

- 500g/600g less than 5% fat minced beef
- 2 small red onions, finely chopped
- 1 red pepper, finely chopped
- 1 tin chopped tomatoes
- 1 tbsp Worchester sauce
- 1 beef stock cube
- 8 lasagne sheets

#### Seasoning mix:

Mix all seasoning ingredients together & leave aside:

- 1/2 tsp chilli powder
- 1 tsp paprika
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp cumin
- 1/2 tsp cayenne chilli powder
- 1/2 tsp garlic powder
- 1/2 tsp sweetener
- 1 tsp dried oregano

- 4 large potatoes chipped

## Directions:

- Par-boil the lasagne sheets for a couple of mins till they start to soften.
  Cut them into triangle nacho shapes.
- Preheat the oven to 200 and line the oven tray with baking paper, lay nachos
  out and spray with Frylight, bake for approx. 10mins, turning half way
  throughout and re-spray, until golden brown.
- Add chips to the oven, sprayed with Frylight and seasoned to taste, bake for
  30-40mins till golden.
- Fry the onion and pepper in Frylight until soften.
- Add the beef and fry until lightly browned.
- Add the spice mix and stir well, add Worchester sauce and crumble in beef
  stock
- Add the tin of tomatoes and stir well, adding a little water if sauce looks
  dry.
- Simmer for 20 mins.
- Add 80g reduced fat red cheddar, grated

#### Taco Sauce:

Mix all the ingredients well until smooth and combined. Use more or less water
depending on your own taste:

- 3 tablespoons of extra light mayo
- 3 tablespoons of fat free natural yogurt
- 2 tablespoons ketchup
- 1/2 tsp cayenne chilli pepper
- 1 tsp minced garlic
- 3-4 tablespoon water

#### Assembly:

Take a bowl/plate.

Layer chips first, then mince sauce, then taco sauce, then nachos and then
cheese and voila!
