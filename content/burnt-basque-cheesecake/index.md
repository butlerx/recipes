This recipe makes one 10" cheesecake. It can be made a day ahead, covered, and chilled. Be sure to let it sit for
several hours at room temperature to chill before serving.

## Ingredients

- 910g Cream Cheese, room temperature
- 300g caster Sugar
- 6 large eggs
- 480ml heavy cream
- 1/2 tsp of fine sea salt
- 1 tsp. vanilla extract
- 40g of plain flour

## Special Equipment

- A 10"(diameter) springform pan

## Directions

1. Place a rack in the middle of the oven; preheat to 200°C. Butter pan, then line with two overlapping 16x12" sheets of
   parchment, making sure parchment comes at least 2" above the top of pan on all sides. Because the parchment needs to
   be pleated and creased in some areas to fit in the pan, you won't end up with a clean, smooth outer edge to the cake;
   that's okay! Place the pan on a rimmed baking sheet.
2. Beat cream cheese and sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment on medium-low speed,
   Scrape down the sides of the bowl until it is very smooth, no lumps remain, and the sugar has dissolved for about 2
   minutes.
3. Increase speed to medium and add eggs one at a time, beating each egg 15 seconds before adding the next. Scrape down
   the sides of the bowl, then reduce the mixer speed to medium-low. Add cream, salt, and vanilla and beat until
   combined, about 30 seconds.
4. Turn off the mixer and sift flour evenly over the cream cheese mixture using a fine-mesh sieve. Beat on low speed
   until incorporated, about 15 seconds. Scrape down the sides of the bowl (yet again) and continue to beat until the
   batter is smooth, homogeneous, and silky, about 10 seconds.
5. Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake cheesecake until deeply golden brown on top and still very jiggly in the centre,
   60–65 minutes.
6. Let cool slightly (it will fall drastically as it cools), then unmold. Let cool completely. Carefully peel away the
   parchment from the sides of the cheesecake. Slice into wedges and serve at room temperature
