French pastries. One of my favorite pastries !

## Ingredients

- 100 grams of flour
- 50 grams of unsalted butter
- 250 grams of sugar
- 2 eggs + 2 egg yolk
- 1/2 liter of milk (2%)
- 1 or 2 vanilla pod (you can use pure vanilla extraction)
- 1 pinch of salt
- 1 or 2 tbsp of rhum (prefer old rhum the brown one)

## Directions:

1.  Mix together the flour and the sugar in a big bowl
2.  Make the milk, the butter and the vanilla boil in a saucepan
3.  Add to the flour and sugar the eggs (all the yolk and the 2 eggs) in one
    time and add the hot milk little by little. Whip everything together you
    should get a fluid texture (without lumps)
4.  Let it cool down
5.  Add the rhum and the salt
6.  Let it rest for 1 hour in the fridge
7.  You will need canelés mold (I think you can use cupcake one but I never
    tried (see attached picture to see what is look like)
8.  Preheat your oven at 240 Celsius (465 Fahrenheit) if you use Sylicon mold
    like me 220 Celsius or 430 Fahrenheit)
9.  Buttering the mold (only if not in Sylicon)
10. Fill molds only at \~3/4
11. Put it in the oven for 14 minutes
12. Then lower the temperature to 180 Celsius (355 farenheit) and let it cook
    for another hour (Don\'t take the mold out of the oven
    :slightly_smiling_face: )
13. Unmold when hot !

It is ready !!! Enjoy !!!!
