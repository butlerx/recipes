This is a childhood favorite and I recently found a well written recipe to reproduce it here:

[RECIPE](https://thewoksoflife.com/shanghai-style-braised-pork-belly/)

I recommend these modifications:

- Use a lot less soya sauce, or it will be too salty. A simple way to do this is to swap the quantities of dark vs light
  soya sauce, or replace the light with dark altogether. Dark soya sauce is less salty than light, so using more of it
  gives you the colour and flavour without as much saltiness.

- If you're cooking with an electric stove like me, you're not likely to get as much heat in your wok. Therefore, don't
  add the full quantity of water prescribed by this recipe at once. You want to manage the liquid level (meat partially
  submerged) through natural evaporation, and if your wok is too cold you'll end up making a soup.

- Also, with an electric stove, the caramelization of the sugar in oil takes A long time (up to 45 min). The recipe
  doesn't really warn you of this. Don't give up too early, the sweet spot is after bubbles form and before the sugar
  turns black (i.e. burned)!
