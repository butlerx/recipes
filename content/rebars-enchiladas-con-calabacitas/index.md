By far my favourite cookbook, Rebar is a vegetarian restaurant located in
Victoria on Vancouver Island. Check it out next time you\'re there! Cook these
up and your house will smell great, and the leftovers are equally delicious!

## Ingredients

- 2 cups [mesa red sauce](../mesa-red-sauce)
- 1 tbsp (30ml) vegetable oil
- 1/2 red onion, diced
- 2 garlic cloves, minced
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/2 tsp coriander seed, toasted and ground
- 1/4 tsp red chile flakes
- 1/2 red pepper, 1/3\" diced
- 2 jalapeno peppers, seeded and minced
- 350 gr zucchini, 1/3\" diced
- 1.5 cups corn, fresh or frozen
- 1/2 tsp cracked pepper
- 1 tbsp cilantro, minced
- 1 cup (480ml) grated Asiago cheese
- 1 cup (480ml) grated Jack cheese
- 10 good quality corn tortillas
- Tip: Want some meat? Throw in some chorizo!

## Directions

1. Begin by preparing the [mesa red sauce](../mesa-red-sauce). Next, prepare the
   vegetables for the filling.
2. Heat oil in a large skillet and saute onion until soft. Add the garlic, salt,
   coriander and chile flakes. Stir and cook for 5 minutes. Add the peppers,
   jalapenos and zucchini and saute until the corn is just tender. The goal is
   to keep the vegetables firm. Work quick and use high heat. Turn the
   vegetables out into a large bowl or spread on a tray to let cool. Stir in
   cilantro, cracked pepper, and 1 cup of each cheese. Set aside
3. Heat a skillet over medium-high and brush with oil. Working with one tortilla
   at a time, place the tortilla in the hot pan. When small bubbles appear on
   the underside, flip it over and heat the other side briefly. Transfer to a
   plate and cover with a clean kitchen towel. Repeat with remaining tortillas,
   lightly brushing the pan with oil between each one.
4. Pre-heat oven to 350 degrees F. Lightly oil a 9\" x 13\" glass baking dish.
   Ladle just enough mesa sauce into the pan to cover the bottom. Lay one or
   more tortillas out before you. Spoon about 1/4 cup (60ml) filling into the
   center of the tortilla, spreading it out horizontally to reach both sides.
   Roll the tortilla up from the bottom edge and over the filling to form a
   cylinder. Place seam side down in the dish. Repeat with remaining tortillas.
   Spoon mesa sauce over the enchiladas, cover with foil and bake for 20
   minutes. Remove foil, sprinkle remaining cheese over top and bake until
   cheese is melted and golden. Serve Hot!
