## Ingredients

- 300g Beef mince
- 200g Pork mince
- 1 finely diced medium sized onion
- 1/2 tps salt
- 1/2 tps pepper
- 1/2 tsp dried thyme or 1 tsp fresh. NB most important flavour component IMO.
- 1.5 tbsp Paxo breadcrumb soaked in 50ml milk OR 100ml fresh breadcrumb soaked in ~75ml milk
- 1 egg

## Directions

1. Dice the onion very finely and fry on medium heat until crisp and fairly dry, some burning is ok.
1. Soak your choice of breadcrumb for 10 minutes while onion is frying.
1. Mix all ingredients well in a big bowl to form a firm, even mixture. Leave mix in fridge overnight ideally or a few
   hours at least.
1. Scaling the recipe works well and you can freeze some of mix for future use.
1. Roll mix into small balls, a little cold water on your palms helps shaping.
1. Fry meatballs till cooked through. Serve with new potatoes and lingon or cranberry jam.
1. You can make a creamy brown sauce by adding cream etc to the leftover bits in the pan, left as exercise for the
   reader.
