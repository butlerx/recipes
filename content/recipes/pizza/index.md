ingredients:
  - 310ml water (20 C)
  - 80g sourdough starter
  - 10g salt
  - 300g Strong Bread flour
  - 200g 00 flour
directions:
  - Add ingredients in a bowl starting with water as the base and stiring in the
    starter before adding the rest.
  - Mix all the with your fingers or a wooden spoon unitl a shaggy dough is
    formed.
  - If mixing with a stand mixer, speed 2, for 8-10 minutes, the dough will have
    come together and begin to look less shagy but not be fully developed.
  - If mixing by hand, dump dough on to a unfloured counter and perforce slap &
    fold on the dough for 8-10 minutes. It should be firm and hold its shape on
    the counter.
  - Transfer to a bowl Covered with a damp tea towel for bulk Fermentation.
  - Bulk Fermentation will take about 2-3 hours, depending on temp. We want it
    to be 22-25°C. Every 30 Minutes perform a strech and fold on the dough to
    ensure it keeps it's strenght.
  - Dump the dough on to a counter top. Using Both hands to spin the dough we
    want to shape it in to a tight boule.
  - Lightly oil a bowl and place the dough in the bowl.
  - Cover the bowl with a damp tea towel, and place it in the fridge for 12
    hours.
  - Lightly oil a high rimmed baking sheet for holding the dough.
  - Turn the dough out on to a counter and divide the dough in to four.
  - Form each dough in to tight boule. I Prefer to fold the courners of the
    dough on the self, flip the dough and spin with both hands until the dough
    is taught.
  - Place the Dough in to the baking sheet, dust with a light layer of semolina
    and cover with a tea towel
  - Let the dough proof  for 6 hours. Until it is puffy and relaxed.
  - Prior to cooking start your oven as needed to reach 400°C. If you are using
    a conventional oven a pizza stone is recommended and will take about 40 min
    to warm up the stone to max.
  - The top dough will be the top of our Pizza. Dust a work bench with semolina
    and scoop dough out on to it.
  - Starting in the center push the dough down with your fingers pushin the air
    out to the edge.
  - Once flat place 2 table spoons of your sauce of choice on the top of the
    dough and stead over.
  - Top with any toppings of your choice then place some torn mozzerela on top.
  - Drizzle  olive oil on top, and using a pizza peel transfer to your oven.
  - It will take about 90 second to cook fully. To get an even colour and avoid
    burning the pizza should be turned half way though. If you are using a
    conventional oven the pizza will take 3-4 minutes to cook fully and the
    ovens grill should be turned on once the pizza is put in.
