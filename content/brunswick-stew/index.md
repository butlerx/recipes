This was my moms way of getting me and my brothers to eat veggies growing up,
and it worked. I loved this stew. My wife does her own spin with fresher
veggies, homemade sauce and home smoked pork. but the base, easy to prepare
method is a quick and easy way to have a LOT of food around.

## Ingredients

Notes: Can use pulled pork for different flavor
