Ease of cooking: Can you throw ingredients into a pot?

## Ingredients

- 1 tbsp olive oil or your favourite Low Cal oil Spray
- 1 garlic clove, crushed
- 400g can chopped tomatoes
- 1 tsp vegetable stock powder or ½ crumbled stock cube
- 1 tbsp tomato purée
- 1 tsp maple syrup or 1 tsp of sweetener
- Wee handful of Rosemary
- Few basil leaves

## Directions

1.  Heat the olive oil (or fire your spray) in a pan, add the garlic clove and rosemary, then gently fry for 1 min.
    Savour the smell, it\'s divine.
2.  Tip in the chopped tomatoes, vegetable stock powder, tomato purée and syrup (or sweetener), then bring to the boil.
3.  Reduce to low and let it simmer uncovered for at least 15 minutes, stirring occasionally. What you want to see here
    is a good reduction of liquid, really bring out all the extra flavours. To finish, tear a few basil leaves, then
    stir into the sauce.
4.  Get yourself a hand mixer or food processor and chuck everything in. Blitz it until you\'ve got a lovely smooth
    texture.

From here you\'ve got a lovely, simple and versatile tomato sauce that\'s reasonably healthy and a cinch to make. I do a
triple recipe about once a week, store it in the fridge and bring it out for pizza toast, bolognese, pizzas, pasta
bakes, etc
