## Ingredients:

#### For marinade :

- 1 lemon, juiced
- 2 tsp ground cumin
- 2 tsp paprika
- 1-2 tsp hot chilli powder
- 2 spoons greek yogurt/ plant based yoghurt
- 1 tsp Garam Masala
- 2 tsp Ginger and garlic paste(I prefer making a paste from fresh ginger and
  garlic)

#### For the curry:

- 2 cinnamon sticks
- 3 cardamom pods
- 3 whole black peppercorn
- 1 tsp whole cumin
- 1 Bayleaf
- 1 tsp coriander powder
- 1 tsp Garam Masala
- 1 Onions
- 2 tomatoes
- 20 grams cashews, soaked inn water

## Directions:

#### Marinating the chicken:

1.  Mix all the ingredients in a bowl. Add the 300grams chicken cut into small
    pieces to the marinade. Keep the chicken marinated for at least an hour.

2.  Cooking the chicken:
3.  Heat 5 grams of butter and 5 grams of sunflower oil in a pan. Adding the oil
    to prevent butter from getting burnt. Add the marinated chicken to the pan.
    Cook it on low heat until the water from yoghurt is dried out and chicken is
    thoroughly cooked.

#### Cooking the gravy:

1.  Make a paste of cashews and keep it aside
2.  Add another 5 grams of oil and 5 grams of butter to the pan. Add in the
    dried aromatic whole spices into the pan. Let them cook for 30 seconds until
    they release those aromatic oils.
3.  Add the diced onions to the pan and let it cook until the onions are soft
    and mushy. Add the coriander powder and let it cook for 30 seconds.
4.  Now when the onions are cooked, add the tomatoes cut into small pieces and
    let it cook until the tomatoes turn soft and mushy.
5.  Add the above mix to a grinder or nutribullet and make a paste.
6.  Strain the paste into a bowl to prevent any unground spices to come into the
    paste.
7.  Add 5 grams of butter to the pan and add the paste back to the pan and let
    it cook for another 30--40 mins.
8.  Now add the cashew paste and garam masala to the gravy and let it cook for
    another 20 minutes.
9.  Add the cooked chicken and let the gravy cook for 15 mins with the chicken.
10. Optional: To make it more creamy you can add heavy cream/ milk to it as
    well.
