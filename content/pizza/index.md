Sourdough Pizza. Toppings can be what ever you want. Customise as you need.

## Ingredients

- 310ml water (20 C)
- 80g [sourdough starter](../sourdough-starter)
- 8g salt
- 200g Strong Bread flour
- 300g 00 flour

## Directions

1. Add ingredients in a bowl starting with water as the base and stirring in the
   starter before adding the rest.
1. Mix all the with your fingers or a wooden spoon until a shaggy dough is
   formed.
1. If mixing with a stand mixer, speed 2, for 8-10 minutes, the dough will have
   come together and begin to look less shagy but not be fully developed.
1. If mixing by hand, dump dough on to a unfloured counter and perforce slap &
   fold on the dough for 8-10 minutes. It should be firm and hold its shape on
   the counter.
1. Transfer to a bowl Covered with a damp tea towel for bulk Fermentation.
1. Bulk Fermentation will take about 2-3 hours, depending on temp. We want it to
   be 22-25°C. Every 30 Minutes perform a stretch and fold on the dough to
   ensure it keeps it's strength.
1. Dump the dough on to a counter top. Using Both hands to spin the dough we
   want to shape it in to a tight boule.
1. Lightly oil a bowl and place the dough in the bowl.
1. Cover the bowl with a damp tea towel, and place it in the fridge for 12
   hours.
1. Lightly oil a high rimmed baking sheet for holding the dough.
1. Turn the dough out on to a counter and divide the dough in to four.
1. Form each dough in to tight boule. I Prefer to fold the corners of the dough
   on the self, flip the dough and spin with both hands until the dough is
   taught.
1. Place the Dough in to the baking sheet, dust with a light layer of semolina
   and cover with a tea towel
1. Let the dough proof for 6 hours. Until it is puffy and relaxed. Prior to
   cooking start your oven as needed to reach 400°C. If you are using a
   conventional oven a pizza stone is recommended and will take about 40 min to
   warm up the stone to max.
1. The top dough will be the top of our Pizza. Dust a work bench with semolina
   and scoop dough out on to it.
1. Starting in the center push the dough down with your fingers pushing the air
   out to the edge.
1. Once flat place 2 table spoons of your sauce of choice on the top of the
   dough and stead over.
1. Top with any toppings of your choice then place some torn mozzarella on top.
1. Drizzle olive oil on top, and using a pizza peel transfer to your oven.
1. It will take about 90 second to cook fully. To get an even colour and avoid
   burning the pizza should be turned half way though. If you are using a
   conventional oven the pizza will take 3-4 minutes to cook fully and the ovens
   grill should be turned on once the pizza is put in.
