There are many traditional filipino dishes that I wanted to share but this is my all time favorite because it's
basically a Peanut Butter Curry dish!!

**Notes**:

- Atsuete seeds are tricky to find, I get the powder/mix from Aling Mary's on Main (Vancouver). If you ever walked down
  Main Street and your mouth starts watering from a delicious smell - it's them baking Pandesal (filipino bread rolls!)
- Also, I like using Kraft PB instead of making my own :peanuts: so i can eat it faster.
