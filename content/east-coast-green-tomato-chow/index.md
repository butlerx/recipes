This has been passed down for generations. It is something that we put on our table as a kid. Like salt and pepper.

Makes 6-8 Pints

## Ingredients

- 30 Green Tomatoes
- 3 Spanish Onions
- 2 Red Peppers
- 2 Green Peppers
- 6 C Raw Sugar
- 2 C Pickling Vinegar
- 5 tsp celery seed
- 5 tsp curry (your choice)
- 5 tsp pickling salt

## Directions

1. In a large pot chop up the tomato and peppers into large chunks.
1. Chop the onion into thin strings.
1. Cook on medium for about 30 min. After 30 min add the rest of the ingredients and bring to a boil for 5 min.

You can or store as you would, it should be good for a couple years if you wet bath/seal them.

If you are doing small batch fridge pickling(half/quarter recipe), it is good for 3-4 months. The pickles will be ready
in 2 - 3 weeks. The longer you leave them the better they get.
