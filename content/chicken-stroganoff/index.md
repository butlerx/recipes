This recipe has been adapted and modified by myself a few times until I\'ve gotten it to a point where I absolutely love
it. As mentioned, the peas and red wine are fully optional, just make sure to replace the red wine with more broth to
ensure a nice amount of sauce. This could also be made with rice instead of the traditional egg noodles and will taste
just as good (I know from experience!). Feel free to mess around with the ratio of mushrooms to chicken to extra veg as
well.

It roughly serves 2-3 hungry adults or 2 adults and 2 children. I tend to prefer thighs in this dish for more flavour
and fat content, but breasts work well here too. If you do end up using red wine, feel free to drink some with the meal
for an easy pairing!

## Ingredients

- 12 oz Wide Egg noodles
- 3 tbsp unsalted butter
- 1 small chopped onion
- 2 cups of sliced mushrooms
- 0.5 kg of Chicken thighs (or breast) cut into fairly small cubes
- 2 tbsp AP flour
- 1 tsp paprika
- fresh ground pepper to taste
- 1/2 cup chicken broth
- 1/2 cup dry red wine (can sub for 1/2 cup more broth)
- 1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce
- 1/2 cup sour cream (plus more for garnish)
- 2 tbsp fresh chopped parsley (dried can work too)
- 1 cup frozen (small sweet) peas (fully optional)

## Directions

1.  Cook the noodles to the package specifications at some point during the cooking process. (10-12m)
2.  Melt 2 tbsp butter in a large pan over medium-high heat, cook onions until slightly soft. (\~2m)
3.  Add mushrooms and cook, stirring often until slightly browned.(\~2m)
4.  Add the other 1 tbsp butter, diced chicken, flour, paprika, pinch of salt, and some pepper, and mix well.
5.  Cook until chicken is nearing done (maybe 75-85% of the way). (\~4m)
6.  Add in the frozen peas and stir for a minute or two to heat them.
7.  Add in the broth (and if using, the wine) and the Worcestershire sauce. Bring to a simmer and cook until thickened
    and sauce passes the spoon test (coats the back of a spoon nicely). (\~4m)
8.  Stir in the sour cream, and add more salt/pepper to taste. Simmer until chicken is fully cooked. (\~2m)
9.  Divide noodles into your serving plates, spoon stroganoff on top of the noodles evenly.
10. Garnish each plate with a dollop of sour cream, sprinkle with fresh parsley and paprika for garnish/colour
