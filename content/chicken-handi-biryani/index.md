This is NOT from my grandmom or my mom, they both are vegetarians 😋

This is my all-time favourite, I choose biryani over every other dish if I have
some options. This dish is all about good basmati Rice, flavours & fragrance of
clay handi.

## Ingredients

- Rice (Obviously)
- Chicken with bone
- Clarified butter (Ghee)
- Lemon
- Onion
- Indian Garam Masala
- Yogurt
- Salt
- Coriander
- Mint Leaves
- Turmeric powder
- Ginger Garlic paste

## Directions

1. Marinate chicken with all ingredients - lemon juice, turmeric, salt, garam
   masala powder, fried onion, curd, mint and coriander leaves, ginger-garlic
   paste. Keep aside for 3 hours.
2. Just Before cooking, clean and soak the basmati rice with water for 1 hour.
3. Take a handi (Clay bowl) or bowl, transfer the whole marinated chicken to it.
   Cook and soak basmati rice on a high flame. Remove the water and transfer the
   rice to the chicken bowl in 2 layers. Top the 1st layer and 2nd layer with
   some mint, fried onions and coriander leaves with ghee.
4. Seal bowl/handi
5. Take one tin layer plate. Put the handi/bowl on a gas stove with a high flame
   for 13 minutes. After that, make it to medium flame for 23 minutes. Between
   this, turn the handi or bowl multiple times for proper cooking. Switch off
   the gas stove and keep it aside for 10 minutes.

I wish I had a picture of the one that I cooked last week. :(
