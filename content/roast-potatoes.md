## Ingredients

- 1kg floury potatoes, for example, Maris Piper, Rooster, Desire, or King Edward
- 100g rapeseed Oil or 3 Tbsp of duck or goose fat
- 3-4 Fresh Thyme Sprigs
- 6-8 cloves of Garlic
- 2 tsp flour
- sea salt flakes to serve

## Method

1. Put a roasting tin in the oven, one big enough to take the potatoes in a single layer, and heat the oven with fans to
   180C
1. Peel potatoes and cut each into four even-sized pieces if they are medium-sized, 2-3 if smaller
1. Drop the potatoes into a large pan and pour enough cold water to cover them barely.
1. Add salt, then wait for the water to boil.
1. Meanwhile, put all of your chosen fat into the hot roasting tin and heat it in the oven for a few minutes so it's
   hot.
1. As soon as the water reaches a full rolling boil, vigorously lower the heat and simmer the potatoes uncovered for 5
   mins.
1. Drain the potatoes in a colander, then shake the colander back and forth a few times to fluff up the outsides.
1. Sprinkle the flour over the potatoes and give another shake to coat them evenly.
1. Take the roasting tin out of the oven and put on the hob over a gentle heat
1. Put the potatoes into the hot fat and baste them so they are coated all over.
1. Spread them in a single layer, ensuring plenty of room.
1. Add the Garlic and thyme, and place the pan back in the oven.
1. Roast the potatoes for 15 minutes, then remove them from the oven and turn them over.
1. Roast for another 15 minutes and turn them over again.
1. Roast them for a final 10-20 mins; they should be unevenly golden and crispy
1. Scatter with the sea salt flakes while hot
