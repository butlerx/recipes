Too many good recipes to share, so for simplicity I'll just share my dinner :)
Though I used gailan instead of broccoli :)

## Ingredients

- 12 oz beef (For a vegetarian option, use vegetables with low water content,
  such as root vegetables.)
- 1 lb broccoli
- 0.50 carrots
- 2 cloves garlic
- 1 small piece ginger
- 1 stem scallions

#### Marinade Ingredients

- 1 tsp baking soda (you can tenderize meat physically by hammering the meat
  with a meat mallet.)
- 1 tbsp oyster sauce
- 1 tbsp light soy sauce
- 2 tbsp water
- 1 tbsp cornstarch
- 0.25 tsp white pepper
- 1 tsp sugar
- 1 tbsp cooking wine

#### Sauce Ingredients

- 1 tbsp oyster sauce
- 1 tsp light soy sauce
- 1 tsp dark soy sauce
- 1 tbsp water
- 1 tbsp cooking wine

#### Extra Ingredients

- 2 tbsp cooking oil
- 1 pinch salt
- 1 tbsp extra oil
- 1 tsp sesame oil

## Directions

#### Step 1 - Cut & wash beef

Cut the beef (12 oz) against the grain in medium slices. Wash and strain the
blood out of the meat.

#### Step 2 - Create beef marinade

Make the sauce by mixing baking soda (1 tsp), oyster sauce (1 tbsp), light soy
sauce (1 tbsp), water (2 tbsp), cornstarch (1 tbsp), white pepper (0.25 tsp),
sugar (1 tsp), and cooking wine (1 tbsp).

#### Step 3 - Mix beef into marinade

Add the beef (12 oz) to the marinade and massage to have the meat fully covered
with the marinade. Set aside and let it sit for 30 mins.

#### Step 4 - Cut broccoli & vegetables

Cut the broccoli (1 lb) into bite-size pieces.

Cut the carrot (0.50) into thin slivers, the ginger (1 small piece) into small
cubes, the scallions (1 stem) into small pieces on a diagonal, and mince the
garlic. (2 cloves)

#### Step 5 - Create sauce

In a small bowl, mix the oyster sauce (1 tbsp), light soy sauce (1 tsp), dark
soy sauce (1 tsp), water (1 tbsp), cooking wine (1 tbsp), sugar, cornstarch, and
white pepper.

#### Step 6 - Boil broccoli

Boil the broccoli with a little bit of oil and salt and cook it to your
preference. Drain once cooked.

#### Step 7 - Cook beef

Add some cooking oil (1 tbsp) into the marinated beef and mix until all the meat
is lightly coated in oil. This will seal in the juices of the meat.

Heat up the wok to the highest heat then add cooking oil (2 tbsp). Swirl the
cooking oil around the wok to fully coat the bottom and sides. Pour out the
excess oil.

Slowly lower the heat and put in the meat. Cook the beef for around 30-60
seconds. Or when it turns brown before flipping it.

Flip the beef and cook it for 60-90 seconds or until it\'s mostly brown. It\'s
fine if it\'s a little red, because we will continue to cook it with the
vegetables.

Once mostly cooked, turn off the heat and take the meat out from the wok. Set
aside.

#### Step 8 - Stir-fry vegetables & beef

Add the remaining oil and stir-fry the sides.

Add the garlic (2 cloves) and ginger (1 small piece) first and fry for 20-30
seconds. Put in the scallions (1 stem) and carrot slices (0.50) and cook for
another 20-30 seconds. Once cooked, add the broccoli (1 lb). Cook for another
30-40 seconds.

Add back the beef. Cook everything together for 30-45 seconds.

Because the broccoli absorbs a lot of liquid, you can add extra water to the
sauce. We suggest 1 tbsp if needed.

#### Step 9 - Add sauce & stir-fry everything

Add the sauce to the stir-fry and constantly mix for about 1 minute. Add sesame
oil (1 tsp). Once everything is incorporated, add a little more leftover oil to
coat the broccoli- it will make it look very appetizing.
