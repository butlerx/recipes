## Ingrediants

### Mushrooms

- 8 medium to large portobello mushrooms
- 10 garlic cloves, peeled
- 1 onion, peeled and cut into 6 wedges
- 1 1/2 tbsp chipotle chilli flakes
- 1 red chilli
- 4 tsp cumin seeds, roughly crushed in a pestle and mortar
- 1 tbsp coriander seeds,roughly crushed in a pestle and mortar
- 2 tbsp tomato paste
- 400ml olive oil

### Butter Bean Mash

- 1 tin of cooked large butter beans, drained (500g)
- 1 tbsp lemon juice
- 1 tbsp olive oil
- flaked sea salt

## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 150°C fan.
2. Put all the ingredients for the mushrooms and 1 tablespoon of flaked salt
   into a large ovenproof saucepan, for which you have a lid. Arrange the
   mushroom so they are domed side up, then top with a piece of parchment paper,
   pushing it down to cover all the ingredients Cover with the lid, then
   transfer to the oven for 1 hour
3. Turn the mushrooms over, replacing the paper and lid, and return to the oven
   for 20 minutes more, or until the mushrooms are very tender but not falling
   apart.
4. Use a pair of tongs to transfer the mushrooms to a chopping board, then cut
   them in hall and set aside.
5. Use a spoon to remove the onion, garlic and chilli, don't worry if you scoop
   up some of the spices and oil. Put them into the small bowl of a food
   processor and blitz until smooth. Return the blitzed onion mixture to the
   saucepan, along with the mushroom halves, and place on a medium-high heat.
   Cook for about 5 minutes, for all the flavours to come together.
6. While the mushrooms are cooking, make the mash by putting the beans into a
   food processor along with the lemon juice, olive oil, teaspoon flaked salt
   and 2 tablespoons of water. Blitz until completely smooth Transfer to a
   medium saucepan and cook on a medium-high heat for about 3 minutes, stirring,
   until warmed through
7. To serve, divide the butter bean mash between four plates Top with four
   mushroom halves per plate and spoon over a generous amount of the oil and its
   accompanying aromatics, don't use all of it though you can keep it
   refrigerated to spoon over another meal.
