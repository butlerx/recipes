This is typically a Shanghai local cuisine and is one of my favourites. It represents the cooking style of "Thick Oil
and Rad Sauce" of Shanghai food, and almost every local family can cook that. It is usually served as a cold dish
(appetizer) for family gathering, for example, Chinese New year, Moon festival.

I like the flavour because it tastes tender, and a little bit sweet, but not heavy (Unlike another Chinese well-known
Char-Siu pork). It always reminds me of my childhood as the grandma's recipe and people gathered and cooked at home by
themselves.

## Ingredients

- Half duck with tender meats (500-900g)
- Ginger, Spring Onion
- Soy sauce, Dark soy sauce (important)
- Crystal sugar (important)

## Directions
