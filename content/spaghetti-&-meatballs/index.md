I grew up in a heavily Italian neighborhood in New York; nothing says Italian-American cuisine like Spaghetti &
Meatballs.

For authenticity, all measures are US.

## Directions

- Soak 1/2 cup of breadcrumbs in just enough milk to cover them + allow to soak.
- Mix the breadcrumbs, 1/4 cup of flatleaf parsley (or arugula,) 1/2 cup of grated parmesan cheese and 1 large egg (or 3
  tbsp aquafaba) in a large mixing bowl with 1 1/2 pounds of ground beef and 1/2 pound of ground pork and season to
  taste.
- Work all the ingredients together thoroughly with clean hands - the warmth of your hands softens the fat in the meat +
  helps bind the ingredients.
- Form into golf ball-sized balls by rolling between your palms then brown over medium heat in a generous pour of olive
  oil, turning regularly, for about 8 minutes; alternatively, bake in a medium oven (350F) for 15 minutes.
- Yields about 20.

I like this [recipe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=39&v=jh13Xd2loto&feature=youtu.be) for the sauce.

Boil spaghetti in plenty of water (at least two quarts), heavily salted, for 8 minutes or until al dente.

Reserve a ladle of pasta water - the starch in the water helps the sauce stick to the pasta - and toss with sauce and
spaghetti in a serving dish. Top with meatballs.

Leftover meatballs make great sandwiches, hot or cold!
