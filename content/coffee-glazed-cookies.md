## Ingredients

### Cookies

- 250g plain or all-purpose flour

- ½ teaspoon of salt
- 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract
- 115g unsalted butter
- 100g caster sugar
- 50g brown sugar
- 1 large egg
- 175g chocolate chips (we prefer dark, but the choice is yours!)

### Glaze

- 62g icing sugar
- 1 tablespoon of freshly brewed coffee (we find that espresso style coffee
  works best!)

## Method

1. Preheat your oven to 180C. Line a baking tray with a silicone mat or baking
   paper.
2. Whisk the flour, baking powder, baking soda, cornflour, salt and set aside.
3. Whisk together the melted butter, vanilla extract and sugars. Add the egg and
   mix until combined.
4. Add the dry ingredients, and mix until just combined. Fold in the chocolate
   chips.
5. Roll the dough into balls weighing approximately 40g. Place onto your baking
   tray lined with baking paper or a silicone mat.
6. Bake for 10-12 minutes.
7. Allow to cool on the baking tray for 5-10 minutes before transferring to a
   wire rack to cool completely.
8. Brew up a cup of your favourite coffee
9. Make your coffee glaze by whisking together the icing sugar and 1 tbsp
   freshly brewed coffee until smooth and combined. Once cooled, drizzle over
   the cookies.
