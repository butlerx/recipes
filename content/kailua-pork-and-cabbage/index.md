My dad was in the US Army and so we moved around a ton while growing up \-- I
went to a different school every year K-12. We spent 3 years in Hawaii, and they
had the best school lunches \-- seriously, \$0.45 got you a hot lunch with a
veg/fruit side, roll, cookie and a milk or juice box.

One of the meals they served was Kailua pork and cabbage, a classic Hawaiian
luau meal that usually involves burying a whole pig under banana leaves in an
earth oven with smoldering coals. I prefer to use a crock pot though ;) It\'s
that good, though, that I still make my favourite school lunch well into my 30s.

## Ingredients

- Pork shoulder
- liquid smoke
- cabbage
- rice
- sea salt

## Directions

1.  Make flavour holes by stabbing pork with a fork. Generously salt pork
    shoulder, stick in a crock pot, and drizzle about a tsp or two of liquid
    smoke onto it. It\'s super duper powerful stuff so don\'t go overboard.
2.  Set the crock pot for 8 hours and then go do other things.
3.  About an hour before it\'s done, roughly shred up some cabbage and toss into
    the crock pot with the pork. Toss your rice in your rice cooker and get it
    started.
4.  When done, use a fork to shred the pork \-- it should fall apart pretty
    easily. Mix with the cooked cabbage and serve over rice. For authenticity,
    eat with a slice of white bread and cold macaroni salad.
