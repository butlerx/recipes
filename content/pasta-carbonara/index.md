## Ingredients

- 50-80g of dry pasta per person. You can also use fresh pasta if you\'d like;
- 1 whole egg (per person) + 2 egg yolks. Example: for 2 people it would be 2
  whole eggs + 2 egg yolks
- Pecorino cheese (you can also replace for parmegiano regianno if you don\'t
  find it). I don\'t measure this and usually add as much cheese as necessary
  for the creamy texture. Just make sure you don\'t add to much otherwise you
  won\'t have a sauce but instead, a block of melted cheese. If you need some
  guidance I would say 3 tbsp of pecorino cheese per person;
- 80-100g of Guanciale per person. You can find this in italian specialized
  grocery stores (in Vancouver it\'s Bosa Foods). If you can\'t find it, you can
  also use pancetta or bacon;
- Black pepper: as much as you like.

## Directions

1.  Put water with salt to boil and add the pasta when water is boiling
2.  Start frying the guanciale in a frying pan. No oil is necessary as guanciale
    already has a lot of fat. Use medium heat;
3.  While guanciale is frying on the pan and pasta is cooking, prepare the sauce
    and don\'t throw away the fat as it will be really important for the sauce;
4.  The sauce is basically whisking the eggs, egg yolks, pecorino cheese and
    black pepper all together. You don\'t need to spend too much time here, only
    enough for mixing everything;
5.  Once pasta and guanciale is done (if guanciale gets ready before the pasta
    is cooked, set it aside until pasta is done), add the pasta to your frying
    pan (it cannot be insanely hot, but hot enough to cook the eggs without
    making them scrambled eggs) and right after the sauce.
6.  Once you add the sauce, you need to start mixing everything very quickly to
    avoid overcooking the eggs.
7.  Add some water from the pasta as it will help with create the desired sauce
    texture (be careful for not adding too much water, probably 1-2 tbsp of
    water is enough). It\'s important to add the water from the pasta cooking
    process as it has starch and it will help with the sauce texture.
8.  Finish the dish with more pecorino cheese and black pepper as you like.
