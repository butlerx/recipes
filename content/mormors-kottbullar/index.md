## Ingredients

- 300g Beef mince
- 200g Pork mince
- 1 finely diced medium sized onion
- 1/2 tps salt
- 1/2 tps pepper
- 1/2 tsp dried thyme or 1 tsp fresh. NB most important flavour component IMO.
- 1.5 tbps Paxo breadcrumb soaked in 50ml milk OR 100ml fresh breadcrumb soaked
  in \~75ml milk
- 1 egg

## Directions

1.  Dice the onion very finely and fry on medium heat until crisp and fairly
    dry, some burning is ok.
2.  Soak your choice of breadcrumb for 10 minutes whlle onion is frying.
3.  Mix all ingredients well in a big bowl to form a firm, even mixture. Leave
    mix in fridge overnight ideally or a few hours at least.
4.  Scaling the recipe works well and you can freeze some of mix for future use.
5.  Roll mix into small balls, a little cold water on your palms helps shaping.
6.  Fry meatballs till cooked through. Serve with new potatoes and lingon or
    cranberry jam.
7.  You can make a creamy brown sauce by adding cream etc to the leftover bits
    in the pan, left as exercise for the reader.
