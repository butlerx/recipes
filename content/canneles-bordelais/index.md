French pastries. One of my favorite pastries !

## Ingredients

- 100 grams of flour
- 50 grams of unsalted butter
- 250 grams of sugar
- 2 eggs + 2 egg yolk
- 1/2 litre of milk (2%)
- 1 or 2 vanilla pod(you can use pure vanilla extraction)
- 1 pinch of salt
- 1 or 2 tbsp of rum (prefer old rum, the brown one)

## Directions

1.  Mix the flour and the sugar in a big bowl
2.  Make the milk, the butter and the vanilla boil in a saucepan
3.  Add the eggs (all the yolks and the two eggs) to the flour and sugar one at a time and the hot milk little by
    little. Whip everything together. You should get a fluid texture (without lumps)
4.  Let it cool down
5.  Add the Rum and the salt
6.  Let it rest for 1 hour in the fridge
7.  You will need canelés mould (I think you can use cupcake one, but I never tried (see attached picture to see what is
    look like)
8.  Preheat your oven to 240 Celsius (465 Fahrenheit) if you use Silicon mould like me, 220 Celsius or 430 Fahrenheit)
9.  Buttering the mould (only if not in Sylicon)
10. Fill moulds only at \~3/4
11. Put it in the oven for 14 minutes
12. Then lower the temperature to 180 Celsius (355 Fahrenheit) and let it cook for another hour (Don\'t take the mould
    out of the oven :slightly_smiling_face: )
13. Unmold when hot!

It is ready !!! Enjoy !!!!
